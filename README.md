# Göz, Kapalı
An art installation about the perception of time.

_"TIME: The period in which a work or occurrence, an action is taking place, has taken place, or will take place."_

Time is an abstract concept that allows us to understand the sequence of events, their duration, and the relationships between them. Plato defines time in terms of change, and Aristotle says that time exists as long as there is a before and after.

_But what happens to time when we are alone with ourselves, independent of external perceptions?_

"EYE, closed" is a multi-layered narrative system based on the perception of time.
While creating a visual that the experiencer can only experience with their eyes closed, it works through interactive ametric/granular music formation and the possibility of outcomes depending on one's experience.
